What this program does? 
The program uses a titanic excel file which shows information such as
how many survivors there were, passengers' sex, fares, their 
passengerId, among other values recorded. The goal of this project was to read in a CSV of a data into a data frame object using Pandas 
usign graphs as well.

How to use this program?
You have to download the titanic csv file. Once the file is uploaded 
through VS, you can start playing around. Scatterplots, linepplots,
histograms are some of the graphs used to describe some of the
information from the file.

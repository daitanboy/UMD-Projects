What this program does? 
The program extracts information from a table in Wikipedia. The Wikipedia website I used is about a list of the highest grossing films.
The program lists the name of these films in ascending order. 

How to use this program?
A Wikipedia link is inserted in the program. It requests all the information in HTML format. In order to make it look more organized, we use a loop that selects specifically the names of the films in ascending order from each row from the Wikipedia table and remove any text that is written in HTML format.
